# LRUCache

# Task

# Use python to simulate a cache storage system. Build a function that
# takes as an input a stream of requests for different objects and
# gives as an output the hit probability.

# * Use LRU (least recently used) replacement strategy under the following restrictions:

# * There are 5 different objects that can be requested from the cache, e.g.(A1, A2, ....,A5).
# * The cache can store a maximum of 3 objects.
# * Test the function using a random request stream (of any
# distribution, preferably exponential) of length 105 as an input.

# Do not use the predefined LRU cache class in python, define your self a data structure representing the cache.

# For each object request you should update that data structure according to the LRU policy.

# Count the hits or the misses and calculate the hit probability.
